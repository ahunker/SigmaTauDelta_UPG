         <h2>Chapter One - The New Owner</h2>
         
         <p>Many years ago there stood at the corner of a street leading out of Upper Kennington
            Lane
            a great red brick house, covering a goodly area of ground, and surrounded by gardens
            magnificent in their proportions when considered in relation to the populous
            neighbourhood mentioned.
         </p>
         
         <p>Originally a place of considerable pretention; a gentleman's seat in the country probably
            when Lambeth Marsh had not a shop in the whole of it; when Vauxhall Gardens were still
            in nubilus; when no South-Western Railway was planned or thought of; when London was
            comparatively a very small place, and its present suburbs were mere country
            villages—hamlets lying quite remote from the heart of the city.
         </p>
         
         <p>Once, the house in question had been surrounded by a small park, and at that time
            there
            were fish-ponds in the grounds, and quite a stretch of meadow-land within the walls.
            Bit
            by bit, however, the park had been cut up into building ground and let off on building
            leases; the meadows were covered with bricks and mortar, shops were run up where cows
            once chewed the cud, and the roar and rumble of London traffic sounded about the old
            house and the deserted garden, formerly quiet and silent as though situated in some
            remote part of the country.
         </p>
         
         <p>Many a time in the course of the generations that had come and gone, been born and
            buried, since the old house was built, the freehold it covered changed hands. On most
            estates of this kind round London there generally is a residence, which passes like
            a
            horse from buyer to buyer. When it has served one man's need it is put up for sale
            and
            bid for by another. When rows and rows of houses, and line after line of streets,
            have
            obliterated all the familiar marks, it is impossible to cultivate a sentiment as regards
            property; and it is unlikely that the descendants of the first possessors of Walnut-Tree
            House who had grown to be country folk and lived in great state, oblivious of business
            people, and entertaining a great contempt for trade, knew that in a very undesirable
            part of London there still stood the residence where the first successful man of their
            family went home each day from his counting-house over against St. Mildred's Church,
            in
            The Poultry.
         </p>
         
         <p>One very wet evening, in an autumn the leaves of which have been dead and gone this
            many
            a year, Walnut-Tree House, standing grim and lonely in the mournful twilight, looked
            more than ordinarily desolate and deserted.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was not a sign of life about it; the shutters were closed—the rusty iron gates
            were
            fast locked—the approach was choked up with grass and weeds—through no chink did the
            light of a single candle flicker. For seven years it had been given over to rats and
            mice and blackbeetles; for seven years no one had been found to live in it; for seven
            years it had remained empty, while its owner wore out existence in fits of moody
            dejection or of wild frenzy in the madhouse close at hand; and now that owner was
            dead
            and buried and forgotten, and the new owner was returning to take possession. This
            new
            owner had written to his lawyers, or rather he had written to the lawyers of his late
            relative, begging them to request the person in charge of the house to have rooms
            prepared for his arrival; and, when the train drew into the station at Waterloo, he
            was
            met by one of the clerks in Messrs <strong><span class="persName">Timpson</span></strong> and Co.'s office, who, picking out <strong><span class="persName">Mr.
                  Stainton</span></strong>, delivered to that gentleman a letter from the firm, and said he would wait and
            hear if there were any message in reply.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> read the letter—looked at the blank flyleaf—and then, turning back to the
            first words, read what his solicitors had to say all through once again, this time
            aloud.
         </p>
         
         <p>“The house has stood empty for more than seven years,” he said, half addressing the
            clerk
            and half speaking to himself. “Must be damp and uninhabitable; there is no one living
            on
            the premises. Under these circumstances we have been unable to comply with your
            directions, and can only recommend you to go to an hotel till we are able personally
            to
            discuss future arrangements.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Humph,” said the new owner, after he had finished. “I'll go and take a look at the
            place, anyhow. Is it far from here, do you know?” he asked, turning to the young man
            from <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>'.
         </p>
         
         <p>“No, sir; not very far.”</p>
         
         <p>“Can you spare time to come over there with me?” continued <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. The young man
            believed that he could, adding, “If you want to go into the house we had better call
            for
            the key. It is at an estate agent's in the Westminster Bridge Road.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I cannot say I have any great passion for hotels,” remarked the new owner, as he
            took
            his seat in the cab.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Indeed, sir?”</p>
         
         <p>“No; either they don't suit me, or I don't suit them. I have led a wild sort of life:
            not
            much civilisation in the bush, or at the goldfields, I can tell you. Rooms full of
            furniture, houses where a fellow must keep to the one little corner he has hired,
            seem
            to choke me. Then I have not been well, and I can't stand noise and the trampling
            of
            feet. I had enough of that on board ship; and I used to lie awake at nights and think
            how pleasant it would be to have a big house all to myself, to do as I liked in.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes, sir,” agreed the clerk.</p>
         
         <p>“You see, I have been used to roughing it, and I can get along very well for a night
            without servants.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No doubt, sir.”</p>
         
         <p>“I suppose the house is in substantial repair—roof tight, and all that sort of
            thing?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I can't say, I am sure, sir.”</p>
         
         <p>“Well, if there is a dry corner where I can spread a rug, I shall sleep there
            to-night.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The clerk coughed. He looked out of the window, and then he looked at Messrs. <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>'
            client.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I do not think—” he began, apologetically, and then stopped.</p>
         
         <p>“You don't think what?” asked the other.</p>
         
         <p>“You'll excuse me, sir, but I don't think—I really do not think, if I were you, I'd
            go to
            that house to-night.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why not?”</p>
         
         <p>“Well, it has not been slept in for nearly seven years, and it must be blue mouldy
            with
            damp; and if you have been ill, that is all the more reason you should not run such
            a
            risk. And, besides—”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Besides?” suggested <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. “Out with it! Like a postscript, no doubt, that
            'besides' holds the marrow of the argument.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“The house has stood empty for years, sir, because—there is no use in making any secret
            of it—the place has a bad name.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What sort of a bad name—unhealthy?”</p>
         
         <p>“Oh, no!”</p>
         
         <p>“Haunted?”</p>
         
         <p>The clerk inclined his head. “You have hit it, sir,” he said.</p>
         
         <p>“And that is the reason no one has lived there?”</p>
         
         <p>“We have been quite unable to let the house on that account.”</p>
         
         <p>“The sooner it gets unhaunted, then, the better,” retorted <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. “I shall
            certainly stop there to-night. You are not disposed to stay and keep me company, I
            suppose?”
         </p>
         
         <p>With a little gesture of dismay the clerk drew back. Certainly, this was one of the
            most
            unconventional of clients. The young man from <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>' did not at all know what to make
            of him.
         </p>
         
         <p>“A rough sort of fellow,” he said afterwards, when describing the new owner; “boorish;
            never mixed with good society, that sort of thing.”
         </p>
         
         <p>He did not in the least understand this rich man, who treated him as an equal, who
            objected to hotels, who didn't mind taking up his abode in a house where not even
            a
            drunken charwoman could be induced to stop, and who calmly asked a stranger on whom
            he
            had never set eyes before—a clerk in the respectable office of <strong><span class="persName">Timpson</span></strong> and Co., a young
            fellow anxious to rise in the world, careful as to his associates, particular about
            the
            whiteness of his shirts and the sit of his collar and the cut of his coats—to “rough”
            things with him in that dreadful old dungeon, where, perhaps, he might even be expected
            to light a fire.
         </p>
         
         <p>Still, he did not wish to offend the new owner. Messrs. <strong><span class="persName">Timpson</span></strong> expected him to be a
            profitable client; and to that impartial firm the money of a boor would, he knew,
            seem
            as good as the money of a count.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am very sorry,” he stammered; “should only have felt too much honoured; but the
            fact
            is—previous engagement—”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> laughed.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I understand,” he said. “Adventures are quite as much out of your line as ghosts.
            And
            now tell me about this apparition. Does the 'old man' walk?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Not that I ever heard of,” answered the other.</p>
         
         <p>“Is it, then, the miserable beggar who tried to do for himself?”</p>
         
         <p>“It is not the late <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, I believe,” said the young man, in tone which mildly
            suggested that reference to a client of <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>' as a “miserable beggar” might be
            considered bad taste.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Then who on earth is it?” persisted <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>“If you must know, sir, it is a child—a child who has driven every tenant in succession
            out of the house.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The new owner burst into a hearty laugh—a laugh which gave serious offence to <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>'
            clerk.
         </p>
         
         <p>“That is too good a joke,” said <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. “I do not know when I heard anything so
            delicious.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is a fact, whether it be delicious or not,” retorted the young man, driven out
            of all
            his former propriety of voice and demeanour by the contemptuous ridicule this “digger”
            thought fit to cast on his story; “and I, for one, would not, after all I have heard
            about your house, pass a night in it—no, not if anybody offered me fifty pounds
            down.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Make your mind easy, my friend,” said the new owner, quietly. “I am not going to
            bid for
            your company. The child and I can manage, I'll be bound, to get on very comfortably
            by
            ourselves.”
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h2>Chapter Two - The Child</h2>
         
         <p>It was later on in the same evening; <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> had an hour previously taken possession
            of Walnut-Tree House, dismissed his cab, bidden <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>' clerk good evening, and,
            having ordered in wood and coals from the nearest greengrocer, besides various other
            necessary articles from various other tradesmen, he now stood by the front gate waiting
            the coming of the goods purchased.
         </p>
         
         <p>As he waited, he looked up at the house, which in the uncertain light of the street
            lamps
            appeared gloomier and darker than had been the case even in the gathering twilight.
         </p>
         
         <p>The long rows of shuttered windows, the silent solemnity of the great trees, remnants
            of
            a once goodly avenue that had served to give its name to Walnut-Tree House; the
            appalling silence of everything within the place, when contrasted with the noise of
            passing cabs and whistling street boys, and men trudging home with unfurled umbrellas
            and women scudding along with draggled petticoats, might well have impressed even
            an
            unimpressionable man, and <strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong>, spite of his hard life and rough exterior, was
            impressionable and imaginative.
         </p>
         
         <p>“It has an 'uncanny' look, certainly,” he considered; “but is not so cheerless for
            a
            lonely man as the 'bush'; and though I am not over-tired, I fancy I shall sleep more
            soundly in my new home than I did many a night at the goldfields. When once I can
            get a
            good fire up I shall be all right. Now, I wonder when those coals are coming!”
         </p>
         
         <p>As he turned once again towards the road, he beheld on its way the sack of fuel with
            which the nearest greengrocer said he thought he could—indeed, said he would—“oblige”
            him. A ton—half a ton—quarter of a ton, the greengrocer affirmed would be impossible
            until the next day; but a sack—yes—he would promise that. <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong> should bring it round;
            and <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong> was told to put his burden on the truck, and twelve bundles of wood, “and we'll
            make up the rest to-morrow,” added <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong>'s master, with the air of one who has conferred
            a favour.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the distance <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> descried a very grimy <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong>, and a very small boy, coming
            along with the truck leisurely, as though the load had been Herculean.
         </p>
         
         <p>Through the rain he watched the pair advancing and greeted <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong> with a glad voice of
            welcome.
         </p>
         
         <p>“So you've come at last; that's right. Better late than never. Bring them this way.
            I'll
            have this small lot shot in the kitchen for the night.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Begging your pardon, sir,” answered <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong>, “I don't think you will—that is to say, not by
            me. As I told our governor, I'll take 'em to the house as you've sold 'em to the house,
            but I won't set a foot inside it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Do you mean to say you are going to leave them out on the pavement?” asked <strong><span class="persName">Mr.
                  Stainton</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, sir, I don't mind taking them to the front door if it'll be a convenience.”</p>
         
         <p>“That will do. You are a brave lot of people in these parts I must say.”</p>
         
         <p>“As for that,” retorted <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong>, with sack on back and head bent forward, “I dare say we're
            as brave about here as where you come from.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is not impossible,” retorted <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>; “there are plenty of cowards over there
            too.”
         </p>
         
         <p>With a feint of being very much afraid, <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong>, after he had shot his coals on the margin
            of the steps, retreated from the door, which stood partly open, and when the boy who
            brought up the wood was again out with the truck, said, putting his knuckles to his
            eyebrows:
         </p>
         
         <p>“Beg pardon, sir, but I suppose you couldn't give us a drop of beer? Very wet night,
            sir.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No, I could not,” answered <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, very decidedly. “I shall have to shovel these
            coals into the house myself; and, as for the night, it is as wet for me as it is for
            you.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Nevertheless, as <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong> shuffled along the short drive—shuffling wearily—like a man who,
            having nearly finished one day's hard work, was looking forward to beginning another
            hard day in the morning, the new owner relented.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Here,” he said, picking out a sixpence to give him, “it isn't your fault, I suppose,
            that you believe in old women's tales.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Thank you kindly, sir,” <strong><span class="persName">Bill</span></strong> answered; “I am sure I am extremely obliged; but if I was
            in your shoes I wouldn't stop in that house—you'll excuse me, sir, meaning no
            offence—but I wouldn't; indeed I wouldn't.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It seems to have got a good name, at any rate,” thought <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, while retracing
            his steps to the banned tenement. “Let us see what effect a fire will have in routing
            the shadows.”
         </p>
         
         <p>He entered the house, and, striking a match, lighted some candles he had brought in
            with
            him from a neighbouring oil-shop.
         </p>
         
         <p>Years previously the gas company, weary of receiving no profit from the house, had
            taken
            away their meter and cut off their connections. The water supply was in the same case,
            as <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, going round the premises before it grew quite dark, had discovered.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of almost all small articles of furniture easily broken by careless tenants, easily
            removed by charwomen, the place was perfectly bare; and as there were no portable
            candlesticks in which to place the lights the new tenant was forced to make his
            illumination by the help of some dingy mirrors provided with sconces, and to seek
            such
            articles as he needed by the help of a guttering mould candle stuck in the neck of
            a
            broken bottle. After an inspection of the ground-floor rooms he decided to take up
            his
            quarters for the night in one which had evidently served as a library.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the centre of the apartment there was the table covered with leather. Around the
            walls
            were bookcases, still well filled with volumes, too uninviting to borrow, too valueless
            in the opinion of the ignorant to steal. In one corner stood a bureau, where the man,
            who for so many years had been dead even while living, kept his letters and papers.
         </p>
         
         <p>The floor was bare. Once a Turkey carpet had been spread over the centre of the polished
            oak boards, but it lay in its wonted place no longer; between the windows hung a convex
            mirror, in which the face of any human being looked horrible and distorted; whilst
            over
            the mantle-shelf, indeed, forming a portion of it, was a long, narrow glass, bordered
            by
            a frame ornamented with a tracery of leaves and flowers. The ceiling was richly
            decorated, and, spite of the dust and dirt and neglect of years, all the appointments
            of
            the apartment he had selected gave <strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong> the impression that it was a good
            thing to be the owner of such a mansion, even though it did chance to be situated
            as
            much out of the way of fashionable London as the diggings whence he had come.
         </p>
         
         <p>“And there is not a creature but myself left to enjoy it all,” he mused, as he sat
            looking into the blazing coals. “My poor mother, how she would have rejoiced to-night,
            had she lived to be the mistress of so large a place! And my father, what a harbour
            this
            would have seemed after the storms that buffeted him! Well, they are better off, I
            know;
            and yet I cannot help thinking how strange it all is—that I, who went away a mere
            beggar, should come home rich, to be made richer, and yet stand so utterly alone that
            in
            the length and breadth of England I have not a relative to welcome me or to say I
            wish
            you joy of your inheritance.”
         </p>
         
         <p>He had eaten his frugal supper, and now, pushing aside the table on which the remains
            of
            his repast were spread, he began walking slowly up and down the room, thinking over
            the
            past and forming plans for the future.
         </p>
         
         <p>As he was buried in reflection, the fire began to die down without his noticing the
            fact;
            but a sudden feeling of chilliness at length causing him instinctively to look towards
            the hearth, he threw some wood into the grate, and, while the flames went blazing
            up the
            wide chimney, piled on coals as though he desired to set the house alight.
         </p>
         
         <p>While he was so engaged there came a knock at the door of the room—a feeble, hesitating
            knock, which was repeated more than once before it attracted <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton's</span></strong>
            attention.
         </p>
         
         <p>When it did, being still busy with the fire, and forgetting he was alone in the house,
            he
            called out, “Come in.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Along the panels there stole a rustling sort of touch, as if someone were feeling
            uncertainly for the handle—a curious noise, as of a weak hand fumbling about the door
            in
            the dark; then, in a similar manner, the person seeking admittance tried to turn the
            lock.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come in, can't you?” repeated <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>; but even as he spoke he remembered he was,
            or ought to be, the sole occupant of the mansion.
         </p>
         
         <p>He was not alarmed; he was too much accustomed to solitude and danger for that; but
            he
            rose from his stooping position and instinctively seized his revolver, which he had
            chanced, while unpacking some of his effects, to place on the top of the bureau.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come in, whoever you are,” he cried; but seeing the door remained closed, though
            the
            intruder was evidently making futile efforts to open it, he strode half-way across
            the
            room, and then stopped, amazed.
         </p>
         
         <p>For suddenly the door opened, and there entered, shyly and timidly, a little child—a
            child with the saddest face mortal ever beheld; a child with wistful eyes and long,
            ill-kept hair; a child poorly dressed, wasted and worn, and with the mournfullest
            expression on its countenance that face of a child ever wore.
         </p>
         
         <p>“What a hungry little beggar,” thought <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. “Well, young one, and what do you
            want here?” he added, aloud.
         </p>
         
         <p>The boy never answered, never took the slightest notice of his questioner, but simply
            walked slowly round the room, peering into all the corners, as if looking for something.
            Searching the embrasures of the windows, examining the recesses beside the fire-place,
            pausing on the hearth to glance under the library table, and finally, when the doorway
            was reached once more, turning to survey the contents of the apartment with an eager
            and
            yet hopeless scrutiny.
         </p>
         
         <p>“What is it you want, my boy?” asked <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, glancing as he spoke at the child's
            poor thin legs, and short, shabby frock, and shoes wellnigh worn out, and arms bare
            and
            lean and unbeautiful. “Is it anything I can get for you?”
         </p>
         
         <p>Not a word—not a whisper; only for reply a glance of the wistful brown eyes.</p>
         
         <p>“Where do you come from, and who do you belong to?” persisted <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>The child turned slowly away.</p>
         
         <p>“Come, you shall not get off so easily as you seem to imagine,” persisted the new
            owner,
            advancing towards his visitor. “You have no business to be here at all; and before
            you
            go you must tell me how you chance to be in this house, and what you expected to find
            in
            this room.”
         </p>
         
         <p>He was close to the doorway by this time, and the child stood on the threshold, with
            its
            back towards him.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> could see every detail of the boy's attire—his little plaid frock, which he
            had outgrown, the hooks which fastened it; the pinafore, soiled and crumpled, tied
            behind with strings broken and knotted; in one place the skirt had given from the
            body,
            and a piece of thin, poor flannel showed that the child's under habiliments matched
            in
            shabbiness his exterior garments.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Poor little chap,” thought <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>. “I wonder if he would like something to eat.
            Are you hungry, my lad?”
         </p>
         
         <p>The child turned and looked at him earnestly, but answered never a word.</p>
         
         <p>“I wonder if he is dumb,” marvelled <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>; and, seeing he was moving away, put out
            a hand to detain him. But the child eluded his touch, and flitted out into the hall
            and
            up the wide staircase with swift, noiseless feet.
         </p>
         
         <p>Only waiting to snatch a candle from one of the sconces, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> pursued as fast as
            he could follow.
         </p>
         
         <p>Up the easy steps he ran at the top of his speed; but, fast as he went, the child
            went
            faster. Higher and higher he beheld the tiny creature mounting, then, still keeping
            the
            same distance between them, it turned when it reached the top storey and trotted along
            a
            narrow corridor with rooms opening off to right and left. At the extreme end of this
            passage a door stood ajar. Through this the child passed, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> still
            following.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I have run you to earth at last,” he said, entering and closing the door. “Why, where
            has the boy gone?” he added, holding the candle above his head and gazing round the
            dingy garret in which he found himself.
         </p>
         
         <p>The room was quite empty. He examined it closely, but could find no possible outlet
            save
            the door, and a skylight which had evidently not been opened for years.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was no furniture in the apartment, except a truckle bedstead, a rush-bottomed
            chair, and a rickety washstand. No wardrobe, or box or press where even a kitten might
            have lain concealed.
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is very strange,” muttered <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, as he turned away baffled. “Very strange!”
            he repeated, while he walked along the corridor. “I don't understand it at all,” he
            decided, proceeding slowly down the topmost flight of stairs; but then all at once
            he
            stopped.
         </p>
         
         <p>“IT IS THE CHILD!” he exclaimed aloud, and the sound of his own voice woke strange
            echoes
            through the silence of that desolate house. “IT IS THE CHILD!” And he descended the
            principal staircase very slowly, with bowed head, and his grave, thoughtful face graver
            and more thoughtful than ever.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h2>Chapter Three - Seeking for Information</h2>
         
         <p>It was enough to make any man look grave; and as time went on the new owner of
            Walnut-Tree House found himself pondering continually as to what the mystery could
            be
            which attached to the child he had found in possession of his property, and who had
            already driven tenant after tenant out of the premises. Inclined at first to regard
            the
            clerk's story as a joke, and his own experience on the night of his arrival a delusion,
            it was impossible for him to continue incredulous when he found, even in broad daylight,
            that terrible child stealing down the staircase and entering the rooms, looking—looking,
            for something it never found.
         </p>
         
         <p>Never after the first horror was over did <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> think of leaving the house in
            consequence of that haunting presence which had kept the house tenantless. It would
            have
            been worse than useless, he felt. With the ocean stretching between, his spirit would
            still be in the old mansion at Lambeth—his mental vision would always be watching
            the
            child engaged in the weary search to which there seemed no end—that never appeared
            to
            produce any result.
         </p>
         
         <p>At bed and at board he had company, or the expectation of it. No apartment in the
            building was secure from intrusion. It did not matter where he lay; it did not matter
            where he ate; between sleeping and waking, between breakfast and dinner, whenever
            the
            notion seized it, the child came gliding in, looking, looking, looking, and never
            finding; not lingering longer than was necessary to be certain the object of its search
            was absent, but wandering hither and thither, from garret to kitchen, from parlour
            to
            bed-chamber, in that quest which still seemed fresh as when first begun.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> went to his solicitors as the most likely persons from whom to obtain
            information on the subject, and plunged at once into the matter.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Who is the child supposed to be, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Timpson</span></strong>?” he asked, making no secret that he had
            seen it.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, that is really very difficult to say,” answered <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Timpson</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>“There was a child once, I suppose—a real child—flesh and blood?”</p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Timpson</span></strong> took off his spectacles and wiped them.
         </p>
         
         <p>“There were two; yes, certainly, in the time of <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Felix Stainton</span></strong>—a boy and a girl.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“In that house?”</p>
         
         <p>“In that house. They survived him.”</p>
         
         <p>“And what became of them?”</p>
         
         <p>“The girl was adopted by a relation of her father's, and the—boy—died.”</p>
         
         <p>“Oh the boy died, did he? Do you happen to know what he died of?”</p>
         
         <p>“No; I really do not. There was nothing wrong about the affair, however, if that is
            what
            you are thinking of. There never was a hint of that sort.”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> sat silent for a minute; then he said:
         </p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Mr. Timpson</span></strong>, I can't shake off the idea that somehow there has been foul play with
            regard to those children. Who were they?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Felix Stainton's</span></strong> grandchildren. His daughter made a low marriage, and he cast her
            adrift. After her death the two children were received at Walnut-Tree House on
            sufferance—fed and clothed, I believe, that was all; and when the old man died the
            heir-at-law permitted them to remain.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Alfred Stainton</span></strong>?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes; the unhappy man who became insane. His uncle died intestate, and he consequently
            succeeded to everything but the personalty, which was very small, and of which these
            children had a share.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“There was never any suspicion you say, of foul play on the part of the late owner?”</p>
         
         <p>“Dear, dear! No; quite the contrary.”</p>
         
         <p>“Then can you throw the least light on the mystery?”</p>
         
         <p>“Not the least; I wish I could.”</p>
         
         <p>For all that, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> carried away an impression <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Timpson</span></strong> knew more of the matter
            than he cared to tell; and was confirmed in this opinion by a chance remark from <strong><span class="persName">Mr.
                  Timpson's</span></strong> partner, whom he met in the street almost immediately after.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why can't you let the matter rest, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>?” asked the Co. with some irritation of
            manner when he heard the object of their client's visit. “What is the use of troubling
            your head about a child who has been lying in Lambeth Churchyard these dozen years?
            Take
            my advice, have the house pulled down and let or sell the ground for building. You
            ought
            to get a pot of money for it in that neighbourhood. If there were a wrong done it
            is too
            late to set it right now.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What wrong do you refer to?” asked <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> eagerly, thinking he had caught
            <strong><span class="persName">Timpson'</span></strong>s partner napping. But that gentleman was too sharp for him.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I remarked if there were a wrong done—not that there had been one,” he answered;
            and
            then, without a pause, added, “We shall hope to hear from you that you have decided
            to
            follow our advice.”
         </p>
         
         <p>But <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> shook his head.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I will not pull down the old house just yet,” he said, and walked slowly away.</p>
         
         <p>“There is a mystery behind it all,” he considered. “I must learn more about these
            children. Perhaps some of the local tradespeople may recollect them.”
         </p>
         
         <p>But the local tradespeople for the most part were newcomers—or else had not supplied
            “the
            house.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“So far as ever I could understand,” said one “family butcher,” irascibly sharpening
            his
            knife as he spoke, “there was not much to supply. That custom was not worth speaking
            of.
            I hadn't it, so what I am saying is not said on my own account. A scrag end of neck
            of
            mutton—a bit of gravy beef—two pennyworth of sheep's liver—that was the sort of thing.
            Misers, sir, misers; the old gentleman bad, and the nephew worse. A bad business,
            first
            and last. But what else could be expected? When people as can afford to live on the
            fat
            of the land never have a sirloin inside their doors, why, worse must come of it. No,
            sir, I never set eyes on the children to my knowledge; I only knew there were children
            by hearing one of them was dead, and that it was the poorest funeral ever crossed
            a
            decent threshold.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Poor little chap,” thought <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, looking straight out into the street for a
            moment; then added, “lest the family misfortunes should descend to me, you had better
            send round a joint to Walnut-Tree House.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lor', sir, are you the gentleman as is living there? I beg your pardon, I am sure,
            but I
            have been so bothered with questions in regard of that house and those children that
            I
            forget my manners when I talk about them. A joint, sir—what would you please to
            have?”
         </p>
         
         <p>The new owner told him; and while he counted out the money to pay for it <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Parker</span></strong>
            remarked:
         </p>
         
         <p>“There is only one person I can think of sir, likely to be able to give any information
            about the matter.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“And that is?”</p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Mr. Hennings</span></strong>, at the ‘Pedlar's Dog.’ He had some aquaintance with the old lady as was
            housekeeper both to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Felix Stainton</span></strong> and the gentleman that went out of his mind.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Following the advice, the new owner repaired to the ‘Pedlar's Dog,’ where (having
            on his
            first arrival at Walnut-Tree House ordered some creature comforts from that well-known
            public) he experienced a better reception than had been accorded to him by <strong><span class="persName">Mr.
                  Parker</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Do I know Walnut-Tree House, sir?” said <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Hennings</span></strong>, repeating his visitor's question.
            “Well, yes, rather. Why, you might as well ask me, do I know the ‘Pedlar's Dog.’ As
            boy
            and man I can remember the old house for close on five-and-fifty years. I remember
            Mr.
            George Stainton; he used to wear a skull-cap and knee-breeches. There was an orchard
            then where Stainton Street is now, and his whole time was taken up in keeping the
            boys
            out of it. Many a time I have run from him.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Did you ever see anything of the boy and girl who were there, after <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> succeeded
            to the property—<strong><span class="persName">Felix Stainton's</span></strong> grandchildren, I mean?” asked the new owner, when a
            pause in Mr. Henning's reminiscences enabled him to take his part in the
            conversation.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, sir, I may have seen the girl, but I can't bring it to my recollection; the
            boy I
            do remember, however. He came over here two or three times with <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>, who kept
            house for both <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>s, and I took notice of him, both because he looked so peaky
            and old-fashioned, and also on account of the talk about him.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“There was talk about him, then?”</p>
         
         <p>“Bless you, yes, sir; as much talk while he was living as since he died. Everybody
            thought he ought to have been the heir.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why?” enquired the new owner.</p>
         
         <p>“Because there was a will made leaving the place to him.”</p>
         
         <p>Here was information. <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>'s heart seemed to stand still for a second and then
            leap on with excitement.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Who made the will?”</p>
         
         <p>“The grandfather, <strong><span class="persName">Felix Stainton</span></strong>, to be sure; who else should make it?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I did not mean that. Was it not drawn out by a solicitor?”</p>
         
         <p>“Oh! Yes—now I understand you, sir. The will was drawn right enough by <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Quinance</span></strong>, in
            the Lambeth Road, a very clever lawyer.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Not by <strong><span class="persName">Timpson</span></strong>, then? How was that?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“The old man took the notion of making it late one night, and so <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> sent to the
            nearest lawyer she knew of.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes; and then?”</p>
         
         <p>“Well, the will was made and signed and witnessed, and everything regular; and from
            that
            day to this no one knows what has become of it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“How very strange.”</p>
         
         <p>“Yes, sir, it is more than strange—unaccountable. At first <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Quinance</span></strong> was suspected of
            having given it up to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong>; but <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> and <strong><span class="persName">Quinance's</span></strong> clerk—he has succeeded
            to the business now—say that old <strong><span class="persName">Felix</span></strong> insisted upon keeping it himself. So, whether he
            destroyed it or the nephew got hold of it, Heaven only knows; for no man living does,
            I
            think.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“And the child—the boy, I mean?”</p>
         
         <p>“If you want to hear all about him, sir, <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> is the one to tell you. If you have
            a mind to give a shilling to a poor old lady who always did try to keep herself
            respectable, and who, I will say, paid her way honourable as long as she had a sixpence
            to pay it honourable with, you cannot do better than go and see <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>, who will
            talk to you for hours about the time she lived at Walnut-Tree House.”
         </p>
         
         <p>And with this delicate hint that his minutes were more valuable than the hours of
            <strong><span class="persName">Mrs.
                  Toplis</span></strong>, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Hennings</span></strong> would have closed the interview, but that his visitor asked where
            he should be able to find the housekeeper.
         </p>
         
         <p>“A thousand pardons!” he answered, with an air; “forgetting the very cream and marrow
            of
            it, wasn't I? <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>, sir, is to be found in Lambeth Workhouse—and a pity,
            too.”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong> turned away, heart-sick. Was this all wealth had done for his people and
            those connected with them?
         </p>
         
         <p>No man seemed to care to waste a moment in speaking about their affairs; no one had
            a
            good word for or kindly memory of them. The poorest creature he met in the streets
            might
            have been of more use in the world then they. The house they had lived in mentioned
            as
            if a curse rested on the place; themselves only recollected as leaving everything
            undone
            which it befitted their station to do. An old servant allowed to end her days in the
            workhouse!
         </p>
         
         <p>“Heaven helping me,” he thought, “I will not so misuse the wealth which has been given
            me.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The slight put upon his family tortured and made him wince, and the face of the dead
            boy
            who ought to have been the heir seemed, as he hurried along the streets, to pursue
            and
            look on him with a wistful reproach.
         </p>
         
         <p>“If I cannot lay that child I shall go mad,” he said, almost audibly, “as mad, perhaps,
            as <strong><span class="persName">Alfred Stainton</span></strong>.” And then a terrible fear took possession of him. The horror of that
            which is worse than any death made for the moment this brave, bold man more timid
            than a
            woman.
         </p>
         
         <p>“God preserve my senses,” he prayed, and then, determinedly putting that phantom behind
            him, he went on to the Workhouse.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h2>Chapter Four - Brother and Sister</h2>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> had expected to find <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> a decrepit crone, bowed with age and racked
            with rheumatism, and it was therefore like a gleam of sunshine streaming across his
            path
            to behold a woman, elderly, certainly, but carrying her years with ease, ruddy cheeked,
            clear eyed, upright as a dart, who welcomed him with respectful enthusiasm.
         </p>
         
         <p>“And so you are <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Edgar</span></strong>, the son of the dear old Captain,” she said, after the first
            greetings and explanations were over, after she had wiped her eyes and uttered many
            ejaculations of astonishment and expressions of delight. “Eh! I remember him coming
            to
            the house just after he was married, and telling me about the sweet lady his wife.
            I
            never heard a gentleman so proud; he never seemed tired of saying the words, 'My
            wife'.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“She was a sweet lady,” answered the new owner.</p>
         
         <p>“And so the house has come to you, sir? Well, I wish you joy. I hope you may have
            peace,
            and health, and happiness, and prosperity in it. And I don't see why you should not—no,
            indeed, sir.”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong> sat silent for a minute, thinking how he should best approach his
            subject.
         </p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>,” he began at last, plunging into the very middle of the difficulty, “I want
            you to tell me about it. I have come here on purpose to ask you what it all means.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The old woman covered her face with her hands, and he could see that she trembled
            violently.
         </p>
         
         <p>“You need not be afraid to speak openly to me,” he went on. “I am quite satisfied
            there
            was some great wrong done in the house, and I want to put it right, if it lies in
            my
            power to do so. I am a rich man. I was rich when the news of this inheritance reached
            me, and I would gladly give up the property to-morrow if I could only undo whatever
            may
            have been done amiss.”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> shook her head.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah, sir; you can't do that,” she said. “Money can't bring back the dead to life;
            and, if
            it could, I doubt if even you could prove as good a friend to the poor child sleeping
            in
            the churchyard yonder as his Maker did when He took him out of this troublesome world.
            It was just soul rending to see the boy the last few months of his life. I can't bear
            to
            think of it, sir! Often at night I wake in a fright, fancying I still hear the patter,
            patter of his poor little feet upon the stair.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Do you know, it is a curious thing, but he doesn't frighten me,” said <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>;
            “that is when I am in the house; although when I am away from it the recollection
            seems
            to dog every step I take.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What?” cried <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>. “Have you, then, seen him too? There what am I talking about?
            I hope, sir, you will forgive my foolishness.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I see him constantly,” was the calm reply.</p>
         
         <p>“I wonder what it means!—I wonder what it can mean!” exclaimed the housekeeper, wringing
            her hands in dire perplexity and dismay.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I do not know,” answered the new owner, philosophically; “but I want you to help
            me to
            find out. I suppose you remember the children coming there at first?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, sir—well, they were poor <strong><span class="persName">Miss Mary</span></strong>'s son and daughter. She ran away, you know,
            with a <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Fenton</span></strong>—made a very poor match; but I believe he was kind to her. When they
            were brought to us, a shivering little pair, my master was for sending them here.
            Ay,
            and he would have done it, too, if somebody had not said he could be made to pay for
            their keep. You never saw brother and sister so fond of one another—never. They were
            twins. But, Lor'! the boy was more like a father to the little girl than aught else.
            He'd have kept an apple a month rather than eat it unless she had half; and the same
            with everything. I think it was seeing that—watching the love they had, he for her
            and
            she for him, coming upon them unsuspected, with their little arms round one another's
            necks, made the old gentleman alter his mind about leaving the place to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong>; for
            he said to me, one day, thoughtful like, pointing to them, 'Wonderful fond, <strong><span class="persName">Toplis</span></strong>!' and
            I answered, 'Yes, sir; for all the world like the Babes in the Wood;' not thinking
            of
            how lonely that meant—
         </p>
         
         <p>“Shortly afterwards he took to his bed; and while he was lying there, no doubt, better
            thoughts came to him, for he used to talk about his wife and <strong><span class="persName">Miss Mary</span></strong>, and the Captain,
            your father, sir, and ask if the children were gone to bed, and such like—things he
            never used to mention before.
         </p>
         
         <p>“So when he made the will <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Quinance</span></strong> drew out I was not surprised—no, not a bit. Though
            before that time he always spoke of <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> as his heir, and treated him as
            such.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“That will never was found,” suggested <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, anxious to get at another portion of
            the narrative.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Never, sir; we hunted for it high and low. Perhaps I wronged him, but I always thought
            <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> knew what became of it. After the old gentleman's death the children were
            treated shameful—shameful. I don't mean beaten, or that like; but half-starved and
            neglected. He would not buy them proper clothes, and he would not suffer them to wear
            decent things if anybody else bought them. It was just the same with their food. I
            durs'n't give them even a bit of bread and butter unless it was on the sly; and, indeed,
            there was not much to give in that house. He turned regular miser. Hoarding came into
            the family with <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Lancelot Stainton</span></strong>, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong>'s great grandmother, and they went on
            from bad to worse, each one closer and nearer than the last, begging your pardon for
            saying so, sir; but it is the truth.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I fear so, <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>,” agreed the man, who certainly was neither close nor near.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, sir, at last, when the little girl was about six years old, she fell sick,
            and we
            didn't think she would get over the illness. While she was about at her worst, <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong>,
            her father's sister, chanced to be stopping up in London, and, as <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> refused to
            let a doctor inside his doors, she made no more ado but wrapped the child up in
            blankets, sent for a cab, and carried her off to her own lodgings. <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> made no
            objection to that. All he said as she went through the hall was:
         </p>
         
         <p>“'If you take her now, remember, you must keep her.'</p>
         
         <p>“'Very well,' she replied, 'I will keep her.'”</p>
         
         <p>“And the boy? the boy?” cried <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>, in an agony of impatience.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am coming to him, sir, if you please. He just dwindled away after his sister and
            he
            were parted, and died in December, as she was taken away in the July.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What did he die of?”</p>
         
         <p>“A broken heart, sir. It seems a queer thing to say about a child; but if ever a heart
            was broken his was. At first he was always wandering about the house looking for her,
            but towards the end he used to go up to his room and stay there all by himself. At
            last
            I wrote to <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong>, but she was ill when the letter got to her, and when she did come
            up he was dead. My word, she talked to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong>! I never heard any one person say so
            much to another. She declared he had first cheated the boy of his inheritance, and
            then
            starved him to death; but that was not true, the child broke his heart fretting after
            his sister.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes; and when he was dead—”</p>
         
         <p>“Sir, I don't like to speak of it, but as true as I am sitting here, the night he
            was put
            in his coffin he came pattering down just as usual, looking, looking for his sister.
            I
            went straight upstairs, and if I had not seen the little wasted body lying there still
            and quiet, I must have thought he had come back to life. We were never without him
            afterwards, never; that, and nothing else, drove <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> mad. He used to think he was
            fighting the child and killing it. When the worst fits were on him he tried to trample
            it under foot or crush it up in a corner, and then he would sob and cry, and pray
            for it
            to be taken away. I have heard he recovered a little before he died, and said his
            uncle
            told him there was a will leaving all to the boy, but he never saw such a paper. Perhaps
            it was all talk, though, or that he was still raving?'
         </p>
         
         <p>“You are quite positive there was no foul play as regards the child?” asked <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>,
            sticking to that question pertinaciously.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Certain, sir; I don't say but <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Alfred</span></strong> wished him dead. That is not murder,
            though.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am not clear about that,” answered <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <h2>Chapter Five - The Next Afternoon</h2>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> was trying to work off some portion of his perplexities by pruning the grimy
            evergreens in front of Walnut-Tree House, and chopping away at the undergrowth of
            weeds
            and couch grass which had in the course of years matted together beneath the shrubs,
            when his attention was attracted to two ladies who stood outside the great iron gate
            looking up at the house.
         </p>
         
         <p>“It seems to be occupied now,” remarked the elder, turning to her companion. “I suppose
            the new owner is going to live here. It looks just as dingy as ever; but you do not
            remember it, <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong>.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I think I do,” was the answer. “As I look the place grows familiar to me. I do recollect
            some of the rooms, I am sure just like a dream, as I remember . What I would give
            to have a peep inside.”
         </p>
         
         <p>At this juncture the new owner emerged from amongst the bushes, and, opening the gate,
            asked if the ladies would like to look over the place.
         </p>
         
         <p>The elder hesitated; whilst the younger whispered, “Oh, aunt, pray do!”</p>
         
         <p>“Thank you,” said <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong> to the stranger, whom she believed to be a gardener; “but
            perhaps <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> might object.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No; he wouldn't, I know,” declared the new owner. “You can go through the house if
            you
            wish. There is no one in it. Nobody lives there except myself.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Taking charge, I suppose?” suggested <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong> blandly.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Something of that sort,” he answered.</p>
         
         <p>“I do not think he is a caretaker,” said the girl, as she and her relative passed
            into
            the old house together.
         </p>
         
         <p>“What do you suppose he is, then?” asked her aunt.</p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> himself.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nonsense, child!” exclaimed <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong>, turning, nevertheless, to one of the windows, and
            casting a curious glance towards the new owner, who was now, his hands thrust deep
            in
            his pockets, walking idly up and down the drive.
         </p>
         
         <p>After they had been all over the place, from hall to garret, with a peep into this
            room
            and a glance into that, <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong> found the man who puzzled her leaning against one of
            the pillars of the porch, waiting, apparently, for their reappearance.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am sure we are very much obliged to you,” she began, with a hesitation in her
            manner.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Pray do not mention it,” he said.</p>
         
         <p>“This young lady has sad associations connected with the house,” <strong><span class="persName">May</span></strong> proceeded, still
            doubtfully feeling her way.
         </p>
         
         <p>He turned his eyes towards the girl for a moment, and, though her veil was down, saw
            she
            had been weeping.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I surmised as much,” he replied. “She is <strong><span class="persName">Miss Fenton</span></strong>, is she not?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes, certainly,” was the answer; “and you are—”</p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong>,” said the new owner, holding out his hand.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am all alone here,” he went on, after the first explanations were over. “But I
            can
            manage to give you a cup of tea. Pray do come in, and let me feel I am not entirely
            alone in England.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Only too well pleased, <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. May</span></strong> complied, and ten minutes later the three were sitting
            round a fire, the blaze of which leapt and flickered upon the walls and over the
            ceiling, casting bright lights on the dingy mirrors and the dark oak shelves.
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is all coming back to me now,” said the girl softly, addressing her aunt. “Many
            an
            hour  and I have sat on that hearth seeing pictures in the fire.”
         </p>
         
         <p>But she did not see something which was even then standing close beside her, and which
            the new owner had witnessed approach with a feeling of terror that precluded speech.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was the child! The child searching about no longer for something it failed to find,
            but standing at the girl's side still and motionless, with its eyes fixed upon her
            face,
            and its poor, wasted figure nestling amongst the folds of her dress.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Thank Heaven she does not see it!” he thought, and drew his breath, relieved.</p>
         
         <p>No; she did not see it—though its wan cheek touched her shoulder, though its thin
            hand
            rested on her arm, though through the long conversation which followed it never moved
            from her side, nor turned its wistful eyes from her face.
         </p>
         
         <p>When she went away—when she took her fresh young beauty out of the house it seemed
            to
            gladden and light up—the child followed her to the threshold; and then in an instant
            it
            vanished, and <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> watched for its flitting up the staircase all in vain.
         </p>
         
         <p>But later on in the evening, when he was sitting alone beside the fire, with his eyes
            bent on the glowing coals, and perhaps seeing pictures there, as <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong> said she and her
            brother had done in their lonely childhood, he felt conscious, even without looking
            round, that the boy was there once again.
         </p>
         
         <p>And when he fell to thinking of the long, long years during which the dead child had
            kept
            faithful and weary watch for his sister, searching through the empty rooms for one
            who
            never came, and then bethought him of the sister to whom her dead brother had become
            but
            the vaguest of memories, of the summers and winters during the course of which she
            had
            probably forgotten him altogether, he sighed deeply; and heard his sigh echoed behind
            him in the merest faintest whisper.
         </p>
         
         <p>More, when he, thinking deeply about his newly found relative and trying to recall
            each
            feature in her face, each tone of her voice, found it impossible to dissociate the
            girl
            grown to womanhood from the child he had pictured to himself as wandering about the
            old
            house in company with her twin brother, their arms twined together, their thoughts
            one,
            their sorrows one, their poor pleasures one—he felt a touch on his hand, and knew
            the
            boy was beside him, looking with wistful eyes into the firelight, too.
         </p>
         
         <p>But when he turned he saw that sadness clouded those eyes no longer. She was found;
            the
            lost had come again to meet a living friend on the once desolate hearth, and up and
            down
            the wide, desolate staircase those weary little feet pattered no longer.
         </p>
         
         <p>The quest was over, the search ended; into the darksome corners of that dreary house
            the
            child's glance peered no longer.
         </p>
         
         <p>She was come! Through years he had kept faithful watch for her, but the waiting was
            ended
            now.
         </p>
         
         <p>That night <strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong> slept soundly; and yet when morning dawned he knew that once in
            the darkness he wakened suddenly and was conscious of a small, childish hand smoothing
            his pillow and touching his brow.
         </p>
         
         <p>Sweet were the dreams which visited his rest subsequently; sweet as ought to be the
            dreams of a man who had said to his own soul—and meant to hold fast by words he had
            spoken:
         </p>
         
         <p>“As I deal by that orphan girl, so may God deal with me!”</p>
         
         
         
         <h2>Chapter Six - The Missing Will</h2>
         
         <p>Ere long there were changes in the old house. Once again <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong> reigned there, but
            this time with servants under her—with maids she could scold and lads she could
            harass.
         </p>
         
         <p>The larder was well plenished, the cellars sufficiently stocked; windows formerly
            closely
            shuttered now stood open to admit the air; and on the drive grass grew no longer—too
            many footsteps passed that way for weeds to flourish.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was Christmas-time. The joints in the butchers' shops were gay with ribbons; the
            grocers' windows were tricked out to delight the eyes of the—children, young and old,
            who passed along. In <strong><span class="persName">Mr. May's</span></strong> house up the Clapham Road all was excitement, for the
            whole of the family—father, mother, grown-up sons and daughters—girls still in short
            frocks and boys in round jackets—were going to spend Christmas Eve with their
            newly-found cousin, whom they had adopted as a relation with a unanimity as rare as
            charming.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Cousin Mary</span></strong> also was going—<strong><span class="persName">Cousin Mary</span></strong> had got a new dress for the occasion, and was
            having her hair done up in a specially effective manner by <strong><span class="persName">Cissie May</span></strong>, when the toilette
            proceedings were interrupted by half a dozen young voices announcing:
         </p>
         
         <p>“A gentleman in the parlour wants to see you, <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong>. Pa says you are to make haste and
            come down immediately.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Obediently <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong> made haste as bidden and descended to the parlour, to find there the
            clerk from <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>' who met <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Stainton</span></strong> on his arrival in London.
         </p>
         
         <p>His business was simple, but important. Once again he was the bearer of a letter from
            <strong><span class="persName">Timpson</span></strong> and Co., this time announcing to <strong><span class="persName">Miss Fenton</span></strong> that the will of <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Felix Stainton</span></strong>
            had been found, and that under it she was entitled to the interest of ten thousand
            pounds, secured upon the houses in Stainton Street.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Oh! aunt, Oh! uncle, how rich we shall be,” cried the girl, running off to tell her
            cousins; but the uncle and aunt looked grave. They were wondering how this will might
            effect <strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong>.
         </p>
         
         <p>While they were still talking it over—after <strong><span class="persName">Timpsons</span></strong>' young man had taken his departure,
            <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Edgar Stainton</span></strong> himself arrived.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Oh, it's all right!” he said, in answer to their questions. “I found the will in
            the
            room where <strong><span class="persName">Felix Stainton</span></strong> died. Walnut-Tree House and all the freeholds were left to the
            poor little chap who died, chargeable with <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong>'s ten thousand pounds, five hundred to
            <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Toplis</span></strong>, and a few other legacies. Failing <strong><span class="persName">George</span></strong>, the property was to come to me. I
            have been to <strong><span class="persName">Quinance's</span></strong> successor, and found out the old man and <strong><span class="persName">Alfred</span></strong> had a grievous
            quarrel, and that in consequence he determined to cut him out altogether. Where is
            <strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong>?
            I want to wish her joy.”
         </p>
         
         <p><strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong> was in the little conservatory, searching for a rose to put in her pretty brown
            hair. He went straight up to her, and said:
         </p>
         
         <p>“<strong><span class="persName">Mary</span></strong>, dear, you have had one Christmas gift to-night, and I want you to take another
            with it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What is it, <strong><span class="persName">Cousin Edgar</span></strong>?” she asked; but when she looked in his face she must have
            guessed his meaning, for she drooped her head, and began pulling her sweet rose to
            pieces.
         </p>
         
         <p>He took the flower, and with it her fingers.</p>
         
         <p>“Will you have me, dear?” he asked. “I am but a rough fellow, I know; but I am true,
            and
            I love you dearly.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Somehow, she answered him as he wished, and all spent a very happy evening in the
            old
            house.
         </p>
         
         <p>Once, when he was standing close beside her in the familiar room, hand clasped in
            hand,
            <strong><span class="persName">Edgar Stainton</span></strong> saw the child looking at them.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was no sorrow or yearning in his eyes as he gazed—only a great peace, a calm
            which
            seemed to fill and light them with an exquisite beauty.
