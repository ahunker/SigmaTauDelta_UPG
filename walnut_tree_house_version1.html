         <h3>Chapter One - The New Owner</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>Many years ago there stood at the corner of a street leading out of Upper Kennington
            Lane
            a great red brick house, covering a goodly area of ground, and surrounded by gardens
            magnificent in their proportions when considered in relation to the populous
            neighbourhood mentioned.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Originally a place of considerable pretention; a gentleman's seat in the country probably
            when Lambeth Marsh had not a shop in the whole of it; when Vauxhall Gardens were still
            in nubilus; when no South-Western Railway was planned or thought of; when London was
            comparatively a very small place, and its present suburbs were mere country
            villages—hamlets lying quite remote from the heart of the city.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Once, the house in question had been surrounded by a small park, and at that time
            there
            were fish-ponds in the grounds, and quite a stretch of meadow-land within the walls.
            Bit
            by bit, however, the park had been cut up into building ground and let off on building
            leases; the meadows were covered with bricks and mortar, shops were run up where cows
            once chewed the cud, and the roar and rumble of London traffic sounded about the old
            house and the deserted garden, formerly quiet and silent as though situated in some
            remote part of the country.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Many a time in the course of the generations that had come and gone, been born and
            buried, since the old house was built, the freehold it covered changed hands. On most
            estates of this kind round London there generally is a residence, which passes like
            a
            horse from buyer to buyer. When it has served one man's need it is put up for sale
            and
            bid for by another. When rows and rows of houses, and line after line of streets,
            have
            obliterated all the familiar marks, it is impossible to cultivate a sentiment as regards
            property; and it is unlikely that the descendants of the first possessors of Walnut-Tree
            House who had grown to be country folk and lived in great state, oblivious of business
            people, and entertaining a great contempt for trade, knew that in a very undesirable
            part of London there still stood the residence where the first successful man of their
            family went home each day from his counting-house over against St. Mildred's Church,
            in
            The Poultry.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>One very wet evening, in an autumn the leaves of which have been dead and gone this
            many
            a year, Walnut-Tree House, standing grim and lonely in the mournful twilight, looked
            more than ordinarily desolate and deserted.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There was not a sign of life about it; the shutters were closed—the rusty iron gates
            were
            fast locked—the approach was choked up with grass and weeds—through no chink did the
            light of a single candle flicker. For seven years it had been given over to rats and
            mice and blackbeetles; for seven years no one had been found to live in it; for seven
            years it had remained empty, while its owner wore out existence in fits of moody
            dejection or of wild frenzy in the madhouse close at hand; and now that owner was
            dead
            and buried and forgotten, and the new owner was returning to take possession. This
            new
            owner had written to his lawyers, or rather he had written to the lawyers of his late
            relative, begging them to request the person in charge of the house to have rooms
            prepared for his arrival; and, when the train drew into the station at Waterloo, he
            was
            met by one of the clerks in Messrs Timpson and Co.'s office, who, picking out Mr.
            Stainton, delivered to that gentleman a letter from the firm, and said he would wait
            and
            hear if there were any message in reply.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton read the letter—looked at the blank flyleaf—and then, turning back to
            the
            first words, read what his solicitors had to say all through once again, this time
            aloud.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"The house has stood empty for more than seven years,"</span></strong> he said, half addressing the
            clerk and half speaking to himself. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Must be damp and uninhabitable; there is no one
               living on the premises. Under these circumstances we have been unable to comply with
               your directions, and can only recommend you to go to an hotel till we are able
               personally to discuss future arrangements."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Humph,"</span></strong> said the new owner, after he had finished. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I'll go and take a look at
               the place, anyhow. Is it far from here, do you know?"</span></strong> he asked, turning to the
            young man from Timpsons'.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"No, sir; not very far."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Can you spare time to come over there with me?"</span></strong> continued Mr. Stainton. The young
            man believed that he could, adding, <strong><span class="dialogue">"If you want to go into the house we had better
               call for the key. It is at an estate agent's in the Westminster Bridge Road."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I cannot say I have any great passion for hotels,"</span></strong> remarked the new owner, as he
            took his seat in the cab.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Indeed, sir?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"No; either they don't suit me, or I don't suit them. I have led a wild sort of life:
               not much civilisation in the bush, or at the goldfields, I can tell you. Rooms full
               of furniture, houses where a fellow must keep to the one little corner he has hired,
               seem to choke me. Then I have not been well, and I can't stand noise and the
               trampling of feet. I had enough of that on board ship; and I used to lie awake at
               nights and think how pleasant it would be to have a big house all to myself, to do
               as I liked in."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Yes, sir,"</span></strong> agreed the clerk.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"You see, I have been used to roughing it, and I can get along very well for a night
               without servants."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"No doubt, sir."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"I suppose the house is in substantial repair—roof tight, and all that sort of
               thing?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"I can't say, I am sure, sir."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, if there is a dry corner where I can spread a rug, I shall sleep there
               to-night."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The clerk coughed. He looked out of the window, and then he looked at Messrs. Timpsons'
            client.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I do not think—"</span></strong> he began, apologetically, and then stopped.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"You don't think what?"</span></strong> asked the other.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"You'll excuse me, sir, but I don't think—I really do not think, if I were you, I'd
               go
               to that house to-night."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Why not?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, it has not been slept in for nearly seven years, and it must be blue mouldy
               with damp; and if you have been ill, that is all the more reason you should not run
               such a risk. And, besides—"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Besides?"</span></strong> suggested Mr. Stainton. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Out with it! Like a postscript, no doubt, that
               'besides' holds the marrow of the argument."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"The house has stood empty for years, sir, because—there is no use in making any
               secret of it—the place has a bad name."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"What sort of a bad name—unhealthy?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh, no!"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Haunted?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The clerk inclined his head. <strong><span class="dialogue">"You have hit it, sir,"</span></strong> he said.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"And that is the reason no one has lived there?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"We have been quite unable to let the house on that account."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"The sooner it gets unhaunted, then, the better,"</span></strong> retorted Mr. Stainton. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I shall
               certainly stop there to-night. You are not disposed to stay and keep me company, I
               suppose?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>With a little gesture of dismay the clerk drew back. Certainly, this was one of the
            most
            unconventional of clients. The young man from Timpsons' did not at all know what to
            make
            of him.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"A rough sort of fellow,"</span></strong> he said afterwards, when describing the new owner;
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"boorish; never mixed with good society, that sort of thing."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>He did not in the least understand this rich man, who treated him as an equal, who
            objected to hotels, who didn't mind taking up his abode in a house where not even
            a
            drunken charwoman could be induced to stop, and who calmly asked a stranger on whom
            he
            had never set eyes before—a clerk in the respectable office of Timpson and Co., a
            young
            fellow anxious to rise in the world, careful as to his associates, particular about
            the
            whiteness of his shirts and the sit of his collar and the cut of his coats—to
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"rough"</span></strong> things with him in that dreadful old dungeon, where, perhaps, he might
            even be expected to light a fire.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Still, he did not wish to offend the new owner. Messrs. Timpson expected him to be
            a
            profitable client; and to that impartial firm the money of a boor would, he knew,
            seem
            as good as the money of a count.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I am very sorry,"</span></strong> he stammered; <strong><span class="dialogue">"should only have felt too much honoured; but the
               fact is—previous engagement—"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton laughed.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I understand,"</span></strong> he said. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Adventures are quite as much out of your line as ghosts.
               And now tell me about this apparition. Does the 'old man' walk?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Not that I ever heard of,"</span></strong> answered the other.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Is it, then, the miserable beggar who tried to do for himself?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It is not the late Mr. Stainton, I believe,"</span></strong> said the young man, in tone which
            mildly suggested that reference to a client of Timpsons' as a <strong><span class="dialogue">"miserable beggar"</span></strong>
            might be considered bad taste.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Then who on earth is it?"</span></strong> persisted Mr. Stainton.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"If you must know, sir, it is a child—a child who has driven every tenant in
               succession out of the house."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The new owner burst into a hearty laugh—a laugh which gave serious offence to Timpsons'
            clerk.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"That is too good a joke,"</span></strong> said Mr. Stainton. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I do not know when I heard anything
               so delicious."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It is a fact, whether it be delicious or not,"</span></strong> retorted the young man, driven out
            of all his former propriety of voice and demeanour by the contemptuous ridicule this
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"digger"</span></strong> thought fit to cast on his story; <strong><span class="dialogue">"and I, for one, would not, after
               all I have heard about your house, pass a night in it—no, not if anybody offered me
               fifty pounds down."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Make your mind easy, my friend,"</span></strong> said the new owner, quietly. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I am not going to
               bid for your company. The child and I can manage, I'll be bound, to get on very
               comfortably by ourselves."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <hr />
         <h3>Chapter Two - The Child</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>It was later on in the same evening; Mr. Stainton had an hour previously taken possession
            of Walnut-Tree House, dismissed his cab, bidden Timpsons' clerk good evening, and,
            having ordered in wood and coals from the nearest greengrocer, besides various other
            necessary articles from various other tradesmen, he now stood by the front gate waiting
            the coming of the goods purchased.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As he waited, he looked up at the house, which in the uncertain light of the street
            lamps
            appeared gloomier and darker than had been the case even in the gathering twilight.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The long rows of shuttered windows, the silent solemnity of the great trees, remnan</p>
         
         <p>ts of a once goodly avenue that had served to give its name to Walnut-Tree House;
            the
            appalling silence of everything within the place, when contrasted with the noise of
            passing cabs and whistling street boys, and men trudging home with unfurled umbrellas
            and women scudding along with draggled petticoats, might well have impressed even
            an
            unimpressionable man, and Edgar Stainton, spite of his hard life and rough exterior,
            was
            impressionable and imaginative.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It has an 'uncanny' look, certainly,"</span></strong> he considered; <strong><span class="dialogue">"but is not so cheerless for
               a lonely man as the 'bush'; and though I am not over-tired, I fancy I shall sleep
               more soundly in my new home than I did many a night at the goldfields. When once I
               can get a good fire up I shall be all right. Now, I wonder when those coals are
               coming!"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>As he turned once again towards the road, he beheld on its way the sack of fuel with
            which the nearest greengrocer said he thought he could—indeed, said he
            would—<strong><span class="dialogue">"oblige"</span></strong> him. A ton—half a ton—quarter of a ton, the greengrocer affirmed
            would be impossible until the next day; but a sack—yes—he would promise that. Bill
            should bring it round; and Bill was told to put his burden on the truck, and twelve
            bundles of wood, <strong><span class="dialogue">"and we'll make up the rest to-morrow,"</span></strong> added Bill's master, with
            the air of one who has conferred a favour.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In the distance Mr. Stainton descried a very grimy Bill, and a very small boy, coming
            along with the truck leisurely, as though the load had been Herculean.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Through the rain he watched the pair advancing and greeted Bill with a glad voice
            of
            welcome.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"So you've come at last; that's right. Better late than never. Bring them this way.
               I'll have this small lot shot in the kitchen for the night."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Begging your pardon, sir,"</span></strong> answered Bill, <strong><span class="dialogue">"I don't think you will—that is to say,
               not by me. As I told our governor, I'll take 'em to the house as you've sold 'em to
               the house, but I won't set a foot inside it."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Do you mean to say you are going to leave them out on the pavement?"</span></strong> asked Mr.
            Stainton.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, sir, I don't mind taking them to the front door if it'll be a convenience."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"That will do. You are a brave lot of people in these parts I must say."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"As for that,"</span></strong> retorted Bill, with sack on back and head bent forward, <strong><span class="dialogue">"I dare say
               we're as brave about here as where you come from."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It is not impossible,"</span></strong> retorted Mr. Stainton; <strong><span class="dialogue">"there are plenty of cowards over
               there too."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>With a feint of being very much afraid, Bill, after he had shot his coals on the margin
            of the steps, retreated from the door, which stood partly open, and when the boy who
            brought up the wood was again out with the truck, said, putting his knuckles to his
            eyebrows:
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Beg pardon, sir, but I suppose you couldn't give us a drop of beer? Very wet night,
               sir."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"No, I could not,"</span></strong> answered Mr. Stainton, very decidedly. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I shall have to shovel
               these coals into the house myself; and, as for the night, it is as wet for me as it
               is for you."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Nevertheless, as Bill shuffled along the short drive—shuffling wearily—like a man
            who,
            having nearly finished one day's hard work, was looking forward to beginning another
            hard day in the morning, the new owner relented.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Here,"</span></strong> he said, picking out a sixpence to give him, <strong><span class="dialogue">"it isn't your fault, I
               suppose, that you believe in old women's tales."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Thank you kindly, sir,"</span></strong> Bill answered; <strong><span class="dialogue">"I am sure I am extremely obliged; but if
               I was in your shoes I wouldn't stop in that house—you'll excuse me, sir, meaning no
               offence—but I wouldn't; indeed I wouldn't."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It seems to have got a good name, at any rate,"</span></strong> thought Mr. Stainton, while
            retracing his steps to the banned tenement. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Let us see what effect a fire will have
               in routing the shadows."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>He entered the house, and, striking a match, lighted some candles he had brought in
            with
            him from a neighbouring oil-shop.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Years previously the gas company, weary of receiving no profit from the house, had
            taken
            away their meter and cut off their connections. The water supply was in the same case,
            as Mr. Stainton, going round the premises before it grew quite dark, had discovered.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Of almost all small articles of furniture easily broken by careless tenants, easily
            removed by charwomen, the place was perfectly bare; and as there were no portable
            candlesticks in which to place the lights the new tenant was forced to make his
            illumination by the help of some dingy mirrors provided with sconces, and to seek
            such
            articles as he needed by the help of a guttering mould candle stuck in the neck of
            a
            broken bottle. After an inspection of the ground-floor rooms he decided to take up
            his
            quarters for the night in one which had evidently served as a library.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In the centre of the apartment there was the table covered with leather. Around the
            walls
            were bookcases, still well filled with volumes, too uninviting to borrow, too valueless
            in the opinion of the ignorant to steal. In one corner stood a bureau, where the man,
            who for so many years had been dead even while living, kept his letters and papers.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The floor was bare. Once a Turkey carpet had been spread over the centre of the polished
            oak boards, but it lay in its wonted place no longer; between the windows hung a convex
            mirror, in which the face of any human being looked horrible and distorted; whilst
            over
            the mantle-shelf, indeed, forming a portion of it, was a long, narrow glass, bordered
            by
            a frame ornamented with a tracery of leaves and flowers. The ceiling was richly
            decorated, and, spite of the dust and dirt and neglect of years, all the appointments
            of
            the apartment he had selected gave Edgar Stainton the impression that it was a good
            thing to be the owner of such a mansion, even though it did chance to be situated
            as
            much out of the way of fashionable London as the diggings whence he had come.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"And there is not a creature but myself left to enjoy it all,"</span></strong> he mused, as he sat
            looking into the blazing coals. <strong><span class="dialogue">"My poor mother, how she would have rejoiced to-night,
               had she lived to be the mistress of so large a place! And my father, what a harbour
               this would have seemed after the storms that buffeted him! Well, they are better
               off, I know; and yet I cannot help thinking how strange it all is—that I, who went
               away a mere beggar, should come home rich, to be made richer, and yet stand so
               utterly alone that in the length and breadth of England I have not a relative to
               welcome me or to say I wish you joy of your inheritance."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>He had eaten his frugal supper, and now, pushing aside the table on which the remains
            of
            his repast were spread, he began walking slowly up and down the room, thinking over
            the
            past and forming plans for the future.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As he was buried in reflection, the fire began to die down without his noticing the
            fact;
            but a sudden feeling of chilliness at length causing him instinctively to look towards
            the hearth, he threw some wood into the grate, and, while the flames went blazing
            up the
            wide chimney, piled on coals as though he desired to set the house alight.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>While he was so engaged there came a knock at the door of the room—a feeble, hesitating
            knock, which was repeated more than once before it attracted Mr. Stainton's
            attention.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>When it did, being still busy with the fire, and forgetting he was alone in the house,
            he
            called out, <strong><span class="dialogue">"Come in."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Along the panels there stole a rustling sort of touch, as if someone were feeling
            uncertainly for the handle—a curious noise, as of a weak hand fumbling about the door
            in
            the dark; then, in a similar manner, the person seeking admittance tried to turn the
            lock.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Come in, can't you?"</span></strong> repeated Mr. Stainton; but even as he spoke he remembered he
            was, or ought to be, the sole occupant of the mansion.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He was not alarmed; he was too much accustomed to solitude and danger for that; but
            he
            rose from his stooping position and instinctively seized his revolver, which he had
            chanced, while unpacking some of his effects, to place on the top of the bureau.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Come in, whoever you are,"</span></strong> he cried; but seeing the door remained closed, though
            the intruder was evidently making futile efforts to open it, he strode half-way across
            the room, and then stopped, amazed.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>For suddenly the door opened, and there entered, shyly and timidly, a little child—a
            child with the saddest face mortal ever beheld; a child with wistful eyes and long,
            ill-kept hair; a child poorly dressed, wasted and worn, and with the mournfullest
            expression on its countenance that face of a child ever wore.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What a hungry little beggar,"</span></strong> thought Mr. Stainton. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, young one, and what do
               you want here?"</span></strong> he added, aloud.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The boy never answered, never took the slightest notice of his questioner, but simply
            walked slowly round the room, peering into all the corners, as if looking for something.
            Searching the embrasures of the windows, examining the recesses beside the fire-place,
            pausing on the hearth to glance under the library table, and finally, when the doorway
            was reached once more, turning to survey the contents of the apartment with an eager
            and
            yet hopeless scrutiny.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What is it you want, my boy?"</span></strong> asked Mr. Stainton, glancing as he spoke at the
            child's poor thin legs, and short, shabby frock, and shoes wellnigh worn out, and
            arms
            bare and lean and unbeautiful. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Is it anything I can get for you?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Not a word—not a whisper; only for reply a glance of the wistful brown eyes.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Where do you come from, and who do you belong to?"</span></strong> persisted Mr. Stainton.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The child turned slowly away.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Come, you shall not get off so easily as you seem to imagine,"</span></strong> persisted the new
            owner, advancing towards his visitor. <strong><span class="dialogue">"You have no business to be here at all; and
               before you go you must tell me how you chance to be in this house, and what you
               expected to find in this room."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>He was close to the doorway by this time, and the child stood on the threshold, with
            its
            back towards him.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton could see every detail of the boy's attire—his little plaid frock, which
            he
            had outgrown, the hooks which fastened it; the pinafore, soiled and crumpled, tied
            behind with strings broken and knotted; in one place the skirt had given from the
            body,
            and a piece of thin, poor flannel showed that the child's under habiliments matched
            in
            shabbiness his exterior garments.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Poor little chap,"</span></strong> thought Mr. Stainton. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I wonder if he would like something to
               eat. Are you hungry, my lad?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>The child turned and looked at him earnestly, but answered never a word.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I wonder if he is dumb,"</span></strong> marvelled Mr. Stainton; and, seeing he was moving away,
            put out a hand to detain him. But the child eluded his touch, and flitted out into
            the
            hall and up the wide staircase with swift, noiseless feet.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Only waiting to snatch a candle from one of the sconces, Mr. Stainton pursued as fast
            as
            he could follow.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Up the easy steps he ran at the top of his speed; but, fast as he went, the child
            went
            faster. Higher and higher he beheld the tiny creature mounting, then, still keeping
            the
            same distance between them, it turned when it reached the top storey and trotted along
            a
            narrow corridor with rooms opening off to right and left. At the extreme end of this
            passage a door stood ajar. Through this the child passed, Mr. Stainton still
            following.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I have run you to earth at last,"</span></strong> he said, entering and closing the door. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Why,
               where has the boy gone?"</span></strong> he added, holding the candle above his head and gazing
            round the dingy garret in which he found himself.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The room was quite empty. He examined it closely, but could find no possible outlet
            save
            the door, and a skylight which had evidently not been opened for years.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There was no furniture in the apartment, except a truckle bedstead, a rush-bottomed
            chair, and a rickety washstand. No wardrobe, or box or press where even a kitten might
            have lain concealed.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It is very strange,"</span></strong> muttered Mr. Stainton, as he turned away baffled. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Very
               strange!"</span></strong> he repeated, while he walked along the corridor. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I don't understand
               it at all,"</span></strong> he decided, proceeding slowly down the topmost flight of stairs; but
            then all at once he stopped.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"IT IS THE CHILD!"</span></strong> he exclaimed aloud, and the sound of his own voice woke strange
            echoes through the silence of that desolate house. <strong><span class="dialogue">"IT IS THE CHILD!"</span></strong> And he
            descended the principal staircase very slowly, with bowed head, and his grave,
            thoughtful face graver and more thoughtful than ever.
         </p>

         <h3>Chapter Three - Seeking for Information</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>It was enough to make any man look grave; and as time went on the new owner of
            Walnut-Tree House found himself pondering continually as to what the mystery could
            be
            which attached to the child he had found in possession of his property, and who had
            already driven tenant after tenant out of the premises. Inclined at first to regard
            the
            clerk's story as a joke, and his own experience on the night of his arrival a delusion,
            it was impossible for him to continue incredulous when he found, even in broad daylight,
            that terrible child stealing down the staircase and entering the rooms, looking—looking,
            for something it never found.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Never after the first horror was over did Mr. Stainton think of leaving the house
            in
            consequence of that haunting presence which had kept the house tenantless. It would
            have
            been worse than useless, he felt. With the ocean stretching between, his spirit would
            still be in the old mansion at Lambeth—his mental vision would always be watching
            the
            child engaged in the weary search to which there seemed no end—that never appeared
            to
            produce any result.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>At bed and at board he had company, or the expectation of it. No apartment in the
            building was secure from intrusion. It did not matter where he lay; it did not matter
            where he ate; between sleeping and waking, between breakfast and dinner, whenever
            the
            notion seized it, the child came gliding in, looking, looking, looking, and never
            finding; not lingering longer than was necessary to be certain the object of its search
            was absent, but wandering hither and thither, from garret to kitchen, from parlour
            to
            bed-chamber, in that quest which still seemed fresh as when first begun.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton went to his solicitors as the most likely persons from whom to obtain
            information on the subject, and plunged at once into the matter.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Who is the child supposed to be, Mr. Timpson?"</span></strong> he asked, making no secret that he
            had seen it.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, that is really very difficult to say,"</span></strong> answered Mr. Timpson.

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"There was a child once, I suppose—a real child—flesh and blood?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Timpson took off his spectacles and wiped them.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"There were two; yes, certainly, in the time of Mr. Felix Stainton—a boy and a
               girl."</span></strong>

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"And what became of them?"</span></strong>

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"The girl was adopted by a relation of her father's, and the—boy—died."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh the boy died, did he? Do you happen to know what he died of?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"No; I really do not. There was nothing wrong about the affair, however, if that is
               what you are thinking of. There never was a hint of that sort."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton sat silent for a minute; then he said:</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Mr. Timpson, I can't shake off the idea that somehow there has been foul play with
               regard to those children. Who were they?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Felix Stainton's grandchildren. His daughter made a low marriage, and he cast her
               adrift. After her death the two children were received at Walnut-Tree House on
               sufferance—fed and clothed, I believe, that was all; and when the old man died the
               heir-at-law permitted them to remain."</span></strong>
            
         </p>

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Yes; the unhappy man who became insane. His uncle died intestate, and he consequently
               succeeded to everything but the personalty, which was very small, and of which these

         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"There was never any suspicion you say, of foul play on the part of the late
               owner?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Dear, dear! No; quite the contrary."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Then can you throw the least light on the mystery?"</span></strong>

         </p>
         
         
         <p>For all that, Mr. Stainton carried away an impression Mr. Timpson knew more of the
            matter
            than he cared to tell; and was confirmed in this opinion by a chance remark from Mr.
            Timpson's partner, whom he met in the street almost immediately after.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Why can't you let the matter rest, Mr. Stainton?"</span></strong> asked the Co. with some
            irritation of manner when he heard the object of their client's visit. <strong><span class="dialogue">"What is the
               use of troubling your head about a child who has been lying in Lambeth Churchyard
               these dozen years? Take my advice, have the house pulled down and let or sell the
               ground for building. You ought to get a pot of money for it in that neighbourhood.
               If there were a wrong done it is too late to set it right now."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What wrong do you refer to?"</span></strong> asked Mr. Stainton eagerly, thinking he had caught
            Timpson's partner napping. But that gentleman was too sharp for him.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I remarked if there were a wrong done—not that there had been one,"</span></strong> he answered;
            and then, without a pause, added, <strong><span class="dialogue">"We shall hope to hear from you that you have
               decided to follow our advice."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>But Mr. Stainton shook his head.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I will not pull down the old house just yet,"</span></strong> he said, and walked slowly away.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"There is a mystery behind it all,"</span></strong> he considered. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I must learn more about these
               children. Perhaps some of the local tradespeople may recollect them."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>But the local tradespeople for the most part were newcomers—or else had not supplied
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"the house."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"So far as ever I could understand,"</span></strong> said one <strong><span class="dialogue">"family butcher,"</span></strong> irascibly
            sharpening his knife as he spoke, <strong><span class="dialogue">"there was not much to supply. That custom was not
               worth speaking of. I hadn't it, so what I am saying is not said on my own account.
               A
               scrag end of neck of mutton—a bit of gravy beef—two pennyworth of sheep's liver—that
               was the sort of thing. Misers, sir, misers; the old gentleman bad, and the nephew
               worse. A bad business, first and last. But what else could be expected? When people
               as can afford to live on the fat of the land never have a sirloin inside their
               doors, why, worse must come of it. No, sir, I never set eyes on the children to my
               knowledge; I only knew there were children by hearing one of them was dead, and that
               it was the poorest funeral ever crossed a decent threshold."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Poor little chap,"</span></strong> thought Mr. Stainton, looking straight out into the street for a
            moment; then added, <strong><span class="dialogue">"lest the family misfortunes should descend to me, you had better
               send round a joint to Walnut-Tree House."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Lor', sir, are you the gentleman as is living there? I beg your pardon, I am sure,
               but I have been so bothered with questions in regard of that house and those
               children that I forget my manners when I talk about them. A joint, sir—what would
               you please to have?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The new owner told him; and while he counted out the money to pay for it Mr. Parker
            remarked:
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"There is only one person I can think of sir, likely to be able to give any

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Mr. Hennings, at the ‘Pedlar's Dog.’ He had some aquaintance with the old lady as
               was
               housekeeper both to Mr. Felix Stainton and the gentleman that went out of his
               mind."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Following the advice, the new owner repaired to the ‘Pedlar's Dog,’ where (having
            on his
            first arrival at Walnut-Tree House ordered some creature comforts from that well-known
            public) he experienced a better reception than had been accorded to him by Mr.
            Parker.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Do I know Walnut-Tree House, sir?"</span></strong> said Mr. Hennings, repeating his visitor's
            question. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, yes, rather. Why, you might as well ask me, do I know the ‘Pedlar's
               Dog.’ As boy and man I can remember the old house for close on five-and-fifty years.
               I remember Mr. George Stainton; he used to wear a skull-cap and knee-breeches. There
               was an orchard then where Stainton Street is now, and his whole time was taken up
               in
               keeping the boys out of it. Many a time I have run from him."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Did you ever see anything of the boy and girl who were there, after Mr. Alfred
               succeeded to the property—Felix Stainton's grandchildren, I mean?"</span></strong> asked the new
            owner, when a pause in Mr. Henning's reminiscences enabled him to take his part in
            the
            conversation.

            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, sir, I may have seen the girl, but I can't bring it to my recollection; the
               boy
               I do remember, however. He came over here two or three times with Mrs. Toplis, who
               kept house for both Mr. Staintons, and I took notice of him, both because he looked
               so peaky and old-fashioned, and also on account of the talk about him."</span></strong>

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Bless you, yes, sir; as much talk while he was living as since he died. Everybody

         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Why?"</span></strong> enquired the new owner.

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Because there was a will made leaving the place to him."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Here was information. Mr. Stainton's heart seemed to stand still for a second and

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh! Yes—now I understand you, sir. The will was drawn right enough by Mr. Quinance,

         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, the will was made and signed and witnessed, and everything regular; and from

            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Yes, sir, it is more than strange—unaccountable. At first Mr. Quinance was suspected

               succeeded to the business now—say that old Felix insisted upon keeping it himself.
               So, whether he destroyed it or the nephew got hold of it, Heaven only knows; for no

               respectable, and who, I will say, paid her way honourable as long as she had a
               sixpence to pay it honourable with, you cannot do better than go and see Mrs.

         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"A thousand pardons!"</span></strong> he answered, with an air; <strong><span class="dialogue">"forgetting the very cream and
               marrow of it, wasn't I? Mrs. Toplis, sir, is to be found in Lambeth Workhouse—and

         <p>Edgar Stainton turned away, heart-sick. Was this all wealth had done for his people
            and
            those connected with them?
         </p>
         
         
         <p>No man seemed to care to waste a moment in speaking about their affairs; no one had
            a
            good word for or kindly memory of them. The poorest creature he met in the streets
            might
            have been of more use in the world then they. The house they had lived in mentioned
            as
            if a curse rested on the place; themselves only recollected as leaving everything
            undone
            which it befitted their station to do. An old servant allowed to end her days in the
            workhouse!
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Heaven helping me,"</span></strong> he thought, <strong><span class="dialogue">"I will not so misuse the wealth which has been
               given me."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>The slight put upon his family tortured and made him wince, and the face of the dead
            boy
            who ought to have been the heir seemed, as he hurried along the streets, to pursue
            and
            look on him with a wistful reproach.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"If I cannot lay that child I shall go mad,"</span></strong> he said, almost audibly, <strong><span class="dialogue">"as mad,
               perhaps, as Alfred Stainton."</span></strong> And then a terrible fear took possession of him.
            The horror of that which is worse than any death made for the moment this brave, bold
            man more timid than a woman.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"God preserve my senses,"</span></strong> he prayed, and then, determinedly putting that phantom
            behind him, he went on to the Workhouse.

         <h3>Chapter Four - Brother and Sister</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton had expected to find Mrs. Toplis a decrepit crone, bowed with age and
            racked
            with rheumatism, and it was therefore like a gleam of sunshine streaming across his
            path
            to behold a woman, elderly, certainly, but carrying her years with ease, ruddy cheeked,
            clear eyed, upright as a dart, who welcomed him with respectful enthusiasm.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"And so you are Mr. Edgar, the son of the dear old Captain,"</span></strong> she said, after the
            first greetings and explanations were over, after she had wiped her eyes and uttered
            many ejaculations of astonishment and expressions of delight. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Eh! I remember him
               coming to the house just after he was married, and telling me about the sweet lady
               his wife. I never heard a gentleman so proud; he never seemed tired of saying the
               words, 'My wife'."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"She was a sweet lady,"</span></strong> answered the new owner.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"And so the house has come to you, sir? Well, I wish you joy. I hope you may have
               peace, and health, and happiness, and prosperity in it. And I don't see why you
               should not—no, indeed, sir."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Edgar Stainton sat silent for a minute, thinking how he should best approach his
            subject.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Mrs. Toplis,"</span></strong> he began at last, plunging into the very middle of the difficulty,
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"I want you to tell me about it. I have come here on purpose to ask you what it
               all means."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>The old woman covered her face with her hands, and he could see that she trembled
            violently.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"You need not be afraid to speak openly to me,"</span></strong> he went on. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I am quite satisfied
               there was some great wrong done in the house, and I want to put it right, if it lies
               in my power to do so. I am a rich man. I was rich when the news of this inheritance
               reached me, and I would gladly give up the property to-morrow if I could only undo
               whatever may have been done amiss."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Mrs. Toplis shook her head.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Ah, sir; you can't do that,"</span></strong> she said. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Money can't bring back the dead to life;
               and, if it could, I doubt if even you could prove as good a friend to the poor child
               sleeping in the churchyard yonder as his Maker did when He took him out of this
               troublesome world. It was just soul rending to see the boy the last few months of
               his life. I can't bear to think of it, sir! Often at night I wake in a fright,
               fancying I still hear the patter, patter of his poor little feet upon the
               stair."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Do you know, it is a curious thing, but he doesn't frighten me,"</span></strong> said Mr. Stainton;
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"that is when I am in the house; although when I am away from it the recollection
               seems to dog every step I take."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What?"</span></strong> cried Mrs. Toplis. <strong><span class="dialogue">"Have you, then, seen him too? There what am I talking
               about? I hope, sir, you will forgive my foolishness."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I see him constantly,"</span></strong> was the calm reply.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I wonder what it means!—I wonder what it can mean!"</span></strong> exclaimed the housekeeper,
            wringing her hands in dire perplexity and dismay.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I do not know,"</span></strong> answered the new owner, philosophically; <strong><span class="dialogue">"but I want you to help
               me to find out. I suppose you remember the children coming there at first?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, sir—well, they were poor Miss Mary's son and daughter. She ran away, you know,
               with a Mr. Fenton—made a very poor match; but I believe he was kind to her. When
               they were brought to us, a shivering little pair, my master was for sending them
               here. Ay, and he would have done it, too, if somebody had not said he could be made
               to pay for their keep. You never saw brother and sister so fond of one
               another—never. They were twins. But, Lor'! the boy was more like a father to the
               little girl than aught else. He'd have kept an apple a month rather than eat it
               unless she had half; and the same with everything. I think it was seeing
               that—watching the love they had, he for her and she for him, coming upon them
               unsuspected, with their little arms round one another's necks, made the old
               gentleman alter his mind about leaving the place to Mr. Alfred; for he said to me,
               one day, thoughtful like, pointing to them, 'Wonderful fond, Toplis!' and I
               answered, 'Yes, sir; for all the world like the Babes in the Wood;' not thinking of
               how lonely that meant—"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Shortly afterwards he took to his bed; and while he was lying there, no doubt, better
               thoughts came to him, for he used to talk about his wife and Miss Mary, and the
               Captain, your father, sir, and ask if the children were gone to bed, and such
               like—things he never used to mention before."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"So when he made the will Mr. Quinance drew out I was not surprised—no, not a bit.
               Though before that time he always spoke of Mr. Alfred as his heir, and treated him
               as such."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"That will never was found,"</span></strong> suggested Mr. Stainton, anxious to get at another
            portion of the narrative.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Never, sir; we hunted for it high and low. Perhaps I wronged him, but I always
               thought Mr. Alfred knew what became of it. After the old gentleman's death the
               children were treated shameful—shameful. I don't mean beaten, or that like; but
               half-starved and neglected. He would not buy them proper clothes, and he would not
               suffer them to wear decent things if anybody else bought them. It was just the same
               with their food. I durs'n't give them even a bit of bread and butter unless it was
               on the sly; and, indeed, there was not much to give in that house. He turned regular
               miser. Hoarding came into the family with Mrs. Lancelot Stainton, Mr. Alfred's great
               grandmother, and they went on from bad to worse, each one closer and nearer than the
               last, begging your pardon for saying so, sir; but it is the truth."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I fear so, Mrs. Toplis,"</span></strong> agreed the man, who certainly was neither close nor
            near.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Well, sir, at last, when the little girl was about six years old, she fell sick, and
               we didn't think she would get over the illness. While she was about at her worst,
               Mrs. May, her father's sister, chanced to be stopping up in London, and, as Mr.
               Alfred refused to let a doctor inside his doors, she made no more ado but wrapped
               the child up in blankets, sent for a cab, and carried her off to her own lodgings.
               Mr. Alfred made no objection to that. All he said as she went through the hall
               was:"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"'If you take her now, remember, you must keep her.'"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"'Very well,' she replied, 'I will keep her.'"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"And the boy? the boy?"</span></strong> cried Mr. Stainton, in an agony of impatience.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"I am coming to him, sir, if you please. He just dwindled away after his sister and
               he
               were parted, and died in December, as she was taken away in the July."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"What did he die of?"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"A broken heart, sir. It seems a queer thing to say about a child; but if ever a heart
               was broken his was. At first he was always wandering about the house looking for
               her, but towards the end he used to go up to his room and stay there all by himself.
               At last I wrote to Mrs. May, but she was ill when the letter got to her, and when
               she did come up he was dead. My word, she talked to Mr. Alfred! I never heard any
               one person say so much to another. She declared he had first cheated the boy of his
               inheritance, and then starved him to death; but that was not true, the child broke
               his heart fretting after his sister."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Yes; and when he was dead—"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Sir, I don't like to speak of it, but as true as I am sitting here, the night he was
               put in his coffin he came pattering down just as usual, looking, looking for his
               sister. I went straight upstairs, and if I had not seen the little wasted body lying
               there still and quiet, I must have thought he had come back to life. We were never
               without him afterwards, never; that, and nothing else, drove Mr. Alfred mad. He used
               to think he was fighting the child and killing it. When the worst fits were on him
               he tried to trample it under foot or crush it up in a corner, and then he would sob
               and cry, and pray for it to be taken away. I have heard he recovered a little before
               he died, and said his uncle told him there was a will leaving all to the boy, but
               he
               never saw such a paper. Perhaps it was all talk, though, or that he was still
               raving?'"</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"You are quite positive there was no foul play as regards the child?"</span></strong> asked Mr.
            Stainton, sticking to that question pertinaciously.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Certain, sir; I don't say but Mr. Alfred wished him dead. That is not murder,
               though."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I am not clear about that,"</span></strong> answered Mr. Stainton.

         <h3>Chapter Five - The Next Afternoon</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>Mr. Stainton was trying to work off some portion of his perplexities by pruning the
            grimy
            evergreens in front of Walnut-Tree House, and chopping away at the undergrowth of
            weeds
            and couch grass which had in the course of years matted together beneath the shrubs,
            when his attention was attracted to two ladies who stood outside the great iron gate
            looking up at the house.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It seems to be occupied now,"</span></strong> remarked the elder, turning to her companion. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I
               suppose the new owner is going to live here. It looks just as dingy as ever; but you
               do not remember it, Mary."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I think I do,"</span></strong> was the answer. <strong><span class="dialogue">"As I look the place grows familiar to me. I do
               recollect some of the rooms, I am sure just like a dream, as I remember Georgie.
               What I would give to have a peep inside."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>At this juncture the new owner emerged from amongst the bushes, and, opening the gate,
            asked if the ladies would like to look over the place.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The elder hesitated; whilst the younger whispered, <strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh, aunt, pray do!"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Thank you,"</span></strong> said Mrs. May to the stranger, whom she believed to be a gardener;
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"but perhaps Mr. Stainton might object."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"No; he wouldn't, I know,"</span></strong> declared the new owner. <strong><span class="dialogue">"You can go through the house
               if you wish. There is no one in it. Nobody lives there except myself."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Taking charge, I suppose?"</span></strong> suggested Mrs. May blandly.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Something of that sort,"</span></strong> he answered.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I do not think he is a caretaker,"</span></strong> said the girl, as she and her relative passed
            into the old house together.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What do you suppose he is, then?"</span></strong> asked her aunt.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Mr. Stainton himself."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Nonsense, child!"</span></strong> exclaimed Mrs. May, turning, nevertheless, to one of the windows,
            and casting a curious glance towards the new owner, who was now, his hands thrust
            deep
            in his pockets, walking idly up and down the drive.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>After they had been all over the place, from hall to garret, with a peep into this
            room
            and a glance into that, Mrs. May found the man who puzzled her leaning against one
            of
            the pillars of the porch, waiting, apparently, for their reappearance.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I am sure we are very much obliged to you,"</span></strong> she began, with a hesitation in her
            manner.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Pray do not mention it,"</span></strong> he said.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"This young lady has sad associations connected with the house,"</span></strong> May proceeded,
            still doubtfully feeling her way.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He turned his eyes towards the girl for a moment, and, though her veil was down, saw
            she
            had been weeping.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I surmised as much,"</span></strong> he replied. <strong><span class="dialogue">"She is Miss Fenton, is she not?"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Yes, certainly,"</span></strong> was the answer; <strong><span class="dialogue">"and you are—"</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Edgar Stainton,"</span></strong> said the new owner, holding out his hand.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"I am all alone here,"</span></strong> he went on, after the first explanations were over. <strong><span class="dialogue">"But I
               can manage to give you a cup of tea. Pray do come in, and let me feel I am not
               entirely alone in England."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Only too well pleased, Mrs. May complied, and ten minutes later the three were sitting
            round a fire, the blaze of which leapt and flickered upon the walls and over the
            ceiling, casting bright lights on the dingy mirrors and the dark oak shelves.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"It is all coming back to me now,"</span></strong> said the girl softly, addressing her aunt.
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Many an hour Georgie and I have sat on that hearth seeing pictures in the
               fire."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>But she did not see something which was even then standing close beside her, and which
            the new owner had witnessed approach with a feeling of terror that precluded speech.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It was the child! The child searching about no longer for something it failed to find,
            but standing at the girl's side still and motionless, with its eyes fixed upon her
            face,
            and its poor, wasted figure nestling amongst the folds of her dress.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Thank Heaven she does not see it!"</span></strong> he thought, and drew his breath, relieved.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>No; she did not see it—though its wan cheek touched her shoulder, though its thin
            hand
            rested on her arm, though through the long conversation which followed it never moved
            from her side, nor turned its wistful eyes from her face.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>When she went away—when she took her fresh young beauty out of the house it seemed
            to
            gladden and light up—the child followed her to the threshold; and then in an instant
            it
            vanished, and Mr. Stainton watched for its flitting up the staircase all in vain.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But later on in the evening, when he was sitting alone beside the fire, with his eyes
            bent on the glowing coals, and perhaps seeing pictures there, as Mary said she and
            her
            brother had done in their lonely childhood, he felt conscious, even without looking
            round, that the boy was there once again.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>And when he fell to thinking of the long, long years during which the dead child had
            kept
            faithful and weary watch for his sister, searching through the empty rooms for one
            who
            never came, and then bethought him of the sister to whom her dead brother had become
            but
            the vaguest of memories, of the summers and winters during the course of which she
            had
            probably forgotten him altogether, he sighed deeply; and heard his sigh echoed behind
            him in the merest faintest whisper.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>More, when he, thinking deeply about his newly found relative and trying to recall
            each
            feature in her face, each tone of her voice, found it impossible to dissociate the
            girl
            grown to womanhood from the child he had pictured to himself as wandering about the
            old
            house in company with her twin brother, their arms twined together, their thoughts
            one,
            their sorrows one, their poor pleasures one—he felt a touch on his hand, and knew
            the
            boy was beside him, looking with wistful eyes into the firelight, too.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But when he turned he saw that sadness clouded those eyes no longer. She was found;
            the
            lost had come again to meet a living friend on the once desolate hearth, and up and
            down
            the wide, desolate staircase those weary little feet pattered no longer.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The quest was over, the search ended; into the darksome corners of that dreary house
            the
            child's glance peered no longer.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>She was come! Through years he had kept faithful watch for her, but the waiting was
            ended
            now.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>That night Edgar Stainton slept soundly; and yet when morning dawned he knew that
            once in
            the darkness he wakened suddenly and was conscious of a small, childish hand smoothing
            his pillow and touching his brow.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Sweet were the dreams which visited his rest subsequently; sweet as ought to be the
            dreams of a man who had said to his own soul—and meant to hold fast by words he had
            spoken:
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"As I deal by that orphan girl, so may God deal with me!"</span></strong>
            
         </p>

         <h3>Chapter Six - The Missing Will</h3>
         
         
         
         
         
         
         <p>Ere long there were changes in the old house. Once again Mrs. Toplis reigned there,
            but
            this time with servants under her—with maids she could scold and lads she could
            harass.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The larder was well plenished, the cellars sufficiently stocked; windows formerly
            closely
            shuttered now stood open to admit the air; and on the drive grass grew no longer—too
            many footsteps passed that way for weeds to flourish.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It was Christmas-time. The joints in the butchers' shops were gay with ribbons; the
            grocers' windows were tricked out to delight the eyes of the—children, young and old,
            who passed along. In Mr. May's house up the Clapham Road all was excitement, for the
            whole of the family—father, mother, grown-up sons and daughters—girls still in short
            frocks and boys in round jackets—were going to spend Christmas Eve with their
            newly-found cousin, whom they had adopted as a relation with a unanimity as rare as
            charming.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Cousin Mary also was going—Cousin Mary had got a new dress for the occasion, and was
            having her hair done up in a specially effective manner by Cissie May, when the toilette
            proceedings were interrupted by half a dozen young voices announcing:
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"A gentleman in the parlour wants to see you, Mary. Pa says you are to make haste and
               come down immediately."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Obediently Mary made haste as bidden and descended to the parlour, to find there the
            clerk from Timpsons' who met Mr. Stainton on his arrival in London.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>His business was simple, but important. Once again he was the bearer of a letter from
            Timpson and Co., this time announcing to Miss Fenton that the will of Mr. Felix Stainton
            had been found, and that under it she was entitled to the interest of ten thousand
            pounds, secured upon the houses in Stainton Street.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh! aunt, Oh! uncle, how rich we shall be,"</span></strong> cried the girl, running off to tell her
            cousins; but the uncle and aunt looked grave. They were wondering how this will might
            effect Edgar Stainton.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>While they were still talking it over—after Timpsons' young man had taken his departure,
            Mr. Edgar Stainton himself arrived.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Oh, it's all right!"</span></strong> he said, in answer to their questions. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I found the will in
               the room where Felix Stainton died. Walnut-Tree House and all the freeholds were
               left to the poor little chap who died, chargeable with Mary's ten thousand pounds,
               five hundred to Mrs. Toplis, and a few other legacies. Failing George, the property
               was to come to me. I have been to Quinance's successor, and found out the old man
               and Alfred had a grievous quarrel, and that in consequence he determined to cut him
               out altogether. Where is Mary? I want to wish her joy."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Mary was in the little conservatory, searching for a rose to put in her pretty brown
            hair. He went straight up to her, and said:
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong><span class="dialogue">"Mary, dear, you have had one Christmas gift to-night, and I want you to take another
               with it."</span></strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"What is it, Cousin Edgar?"</span></strong> she asked; but when she looked in his face she must have
            guessed his meaning, for she drooped her head, and began pulling her sweet rose to
            pieces.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He took the flower, and with it her fingers.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><span class="dialogue">"Will you have me, dear?"</span></strong> he asked. <strong><span class="dialogue">"I am but a rough fellow, I know; but I am
               true, and I love you dearly."</span></strong></p>
         
         
         <p>Somehow, she answered him as he wished, and all spent a very happy evening in the
            old
            house.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Once, when he was standing close beside her in the familiar room, hand clasped in
            hand,
            Edgar Stainton saw the child looking at them.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>There was no sorrow or yearning in his eyes as he gazed—only a great peace, a calm
            which
            seemed to fill and light them with an exquisite beauty.
